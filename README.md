# System Analysis and Design

---------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------------

DriverPass discovered that there are limited opportunities for helping driveres pass their driving exams. They wanted to assist future drivers by creating a website
that can provide drivers with practice, exams, online classes, and on-the-road driving taining given through three different packages. DriverPass hired my company to 
help build this program. They program would have to be built on a web based cloud server and availble for web use. This would also allow for some security measures that
would need to be put in place for information that will be used for the system. The user would need to be able to book and canacel on-the-road training. The owner 
of DriverPass would also like to be able to access the system remotely both online and offline to be able to dowloand data produced by the system. They system would have 
roles assigned to each of the users, allowing and restricting access based off that role. The user should also be able to see their progress within the package, classes, 
or on-the-road training to stay up to date on what they have completed and still need to so. DriverPass would also like the system to be linked to the DMV, this way if 
there is an update to the information at the DMV, they could produce an update and push that update out.

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES
---------------------------------------------------------

Something that was done patictually well was the ability to make the different UML diagrams. This allowed me to see where new features could be added to the system and 
how I could implement that function within the system. A weakness to this project was that some of those fuction were not listed in the requirements from DriverPass. 
A function like the user having the ability to request a reset password link. Fucntions like this are would I would love to go back and work on.

---------------------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION
---------------------------------------------------------

Not only did I look at the needs of what DriverPass needed but also to what the user my need while using the program. Like mentioned above I looked at what they wanted
for the system and saw what was possibly missing from the user. Something like 2FA and locking out the user if they entered in the password wrong a certian number of 
times. Something that I think that the user would need would be the ability to reset the password if the user does not remember the password before they are locked 
out. This is important as they will be the ones using the system. It is important to look at each role of the user and make sure that that the fuctions match what that 
user is going to be doing within the system and that the requirements are met.

---------------------------------------------------------
APPROACH
---------------------------------------------------------

While approaching designing this software I started with looking at what DriverPass was asking for and analyzing that information. Starting with the Business 
Requirements it broke down the purpose of the software, the system background, the objectives and goals, nonfuctional requiments, fuctional requirments, user 
interface, assumptions, limitations and the Gnatt Chart of the sprint breakdown. NExt we looked at UML diagrams and the different diagrams that would need to be made
for the system. This is a tool that I will have in my belt that will stay with me. As it is improtant to make sure that we are meeting the requirments of client and 
the users.
